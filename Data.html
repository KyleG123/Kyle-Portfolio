  <h2>How does the population change in tempurate freshwater fish and humans compare?</h2> 
   <h3 class="floatLeft">Human Population Graph</h3>
   <p class="answer">Human Graph: This line graph shows the percentage increase of the human population from 1970 to 2008. This line  graph is based on the percent of growth from the year of 1970. So 0% represents the starting year (1970).  The population of the humans have not gone up by a large amount, but it was constantly rising throughout the 38 years.  We used a line graph for this graph because we wanted to show how the percentages change every year. So using a line graph which show how steep the population goes up or down. This would give the viewer an easier way to interpret the graph without even having to look at the data right away.

Fish graph: This line  graph is based on the percent of growth from the year of 1970. So 0% represents the starting year (1970). This graph shows how the temperate freshwater fish population has changed from 1970 to 2008.  Over the 38 years the fish population went up and down, but overall the fish population kept going up, just not consistently. We used a line graph for this graph because we wanted to show how the percentages change every year. So using a line graph which show how steep the population goes up or down. This would give the viewer an easier way to interpret the graph without even having to look at the data right away.

    <h2 class="floatLeft">Creative Graph</h2>
  <p>
Creative graph: This graph is goes from 1970 to 2008. The graph that has both of the populations on it shows the two separate graphs combined because this shows the viewer how the data compares very easily. This line  graph is based on the percent of growth from the year of 1970. So 0% represents the starting year (1970). This graph shows that as the human population goes up the fish population also goes up. We used a line graph for this graph because we wanted to show how the percentages change every year. So using a line graph which show how steep the population goes up or down. This would give the viewer an easier way to interpret the graph without even having to look at the data right away.

   <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Conclusion: After looking at our data and graphs we came to the conclusion that as the human population grows the temperate freshwater fish population grows. Over the 38 years the fish population went up and down, but overall the fish population kept going up, just not consistently. The human population went up at a pretty constant rate. It would go up by about 0.01% most of the time. This connects to the real world because lots of fish populations are going down because people are fishing them or destroying their habitats. In this cause it's the opposite which is good. This means that the freshwater fish arenâ€™t in much danger for the future. This is good news because the human population is constantly growing. So if this data keeps up we shouldn't have to worry about temperature freshwater fish.
