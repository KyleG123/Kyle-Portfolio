        <h3> Outdoors </h3>
        <p> Going outside is one of my favorite things to do. There is so much that you can do outside. You can go biking, hiking, walking, etc.
         <br /> I especially like going on vacations and exploring outside and seeing an enviroment other than my home state. One of my favorite
         <br /> vacations that I've gone on was when I went to Hawaii. I went there when I was younger. I liked it so much there because it was
         <br /> very warm and had a tropical feel to it. My favorite thing to do outside is to go mountain biking. Like I mention on my hobbies page.
